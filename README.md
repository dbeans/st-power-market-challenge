# st-power-market-challenge

## Welcome !

Below you can find the description of a analysis challenge that we ask people with coding/analysis skills to perform when applying for a job in our team.

The goal of this coding challenge is to provide the applicant some insight into the business we're in and as such provide the applicant an indication about the challenges she/he will be confronted with. 

Time is scarce, we know. Therefore we ask you not to spend limited time on this challenge. We know it is not possible to deliver a finished implementation of the challenge in only four hours. Even though your submission will not be complete, it will provide us plenty of information and topics to discuss later on during the talks.

This coding-challenge is part of a formal process and is used in collaboration with the recruiting companies we work with.  Submitting a pull-request will not automatically trigger the recruitement process.

## FAQ

##### Can an existing solver be used to calculate the unit-commitment
Implementations should not rely on an external solver and thus contain an algorithm written from scratch (clarified in the text as of version v1.1.0)
